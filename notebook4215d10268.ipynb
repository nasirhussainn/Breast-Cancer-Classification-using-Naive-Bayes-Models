The algorithm is called \"naive\" because it makes the assumption that the features are conditionally independent of each other given the class variable. This means that the presence or absence of one feature does not affect the probability of the presence or absence of another feature.\n","\n","The Naive Bayes algorithm is used for classification problems, where the goal is to predict the class variable given some input features.
